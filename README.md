### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Marco Liu, a passionate and driven Computer Science Master's student at the University of California, San Diego and a Full Stack Developer with expertise in frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and backend (Node.js, Python, Spring Boot) technologies, along with database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and UX/UI design. I specialize in building AI-powered, user-interactive applications and am actively seeking full-time Software Engineer opportunities.

With years of experience delivering high-impact, client-facing applications in family wellness, marketing, and e-learning industries, I have contributed to every stage of the software development lifecycleâ€”from requirement analysis and system design to prototyping, coding, and testing. My goal is to build scalable, user-centric solutions that drive meaningful business impact.
