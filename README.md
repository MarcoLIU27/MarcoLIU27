### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Marco Liu, a passionate and driven Computer Science Masterâ€˜s student at the University of California, San Diego. I have extensive project and research experience in software engineering, AI, and machine learning, and Iâ€™m also constantly looking to expand my knowledge and skills in these fields.

I am actively seeking a summer 2024 software engineer internship that will allow me to apply my technical skills, collaborate with a dynamic team, and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.

As a creative and detail-oriented individual, I take great pride in my work and have a proven track record of successful leadership in group projects. I am committed to delivering high-quality results and am always eager to learn from my peers and mentors. I have strong experience in Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, and Node.js/Express, and have been actively involved in the full lifecycle of user-facing software development from requirement analysis, system design, and product prototyping to coding and testing. Also, I have worked as research intern in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.
